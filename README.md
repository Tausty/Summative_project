# Summative_project
This project is worth 30% of my school's CS course. all content will be stored here. this project is going to be worked on by me alone.

# My idea
the task for this project was to creat anything that your passionate about, and i chose a game, specificly a rougelite game that iv always wanted to make. the game takes inspartion from a viarety of titles, including:a minigame from stardew valley, Risk of Rain 1&2, Tiny Rouges, Enter the Gungeon, Binding of isaac and all its DLC's and APE OUT. 

### the gameplay
the Idea is that a player is interacting with a character in a top down envoirment trying to reach the end of the dungeon to escape back into the real world. enemies will spawn to hinder you, and you can buy things from shops and collect a vareity of powerups and weopons to aid you on your journy. there a vairety of toggalable game chaning unlocks, and 3 uniqe characters to choose from. each chracter will have at least 7 uniqe weopons, and 20 uniqe powerups.
