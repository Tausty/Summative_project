# Summative_project
  
This project is worth 30% of my school's CS course. all content will be stored here. this project is going to be worked on by me alone.  
  
# My idea
  
the task for this project was to creat anything that your passionate about, and i chose a game, specificly a rougelite game that iv always wanted to make. the game takes inspartion from a viarety of titles, including:a minigame from stardew valley, Risk of Rain 1&2, Tiny Rouges, Enter the Gungeon, Binding of isaac and all its DLC's and APE OUT.  
  
## the gameplay
  
the Idea is that a player is interacting with a character in a top down envoirment trying to reach the end of the dungeon to escape back into the real world. enemies will spawn to hinder you, and you can buy things from shops and collect a vareity of powerups and weopons to aid you on your journy. there a vairety of toggalable game chaning unlocks, and 3 uniqe characters to choose from. each chracter will have at least 7 uniqe weopons, and 20 uniqe powerups.  

## implementations

I will be using the C++ version of ncurses for my game, using a consol and a text based output to run it. However ncurses is a limiting software as it can bassicly only do text based output, so if i want to switch to real sprites later that will be tough to figure out

# Future plans

this game is not possible for me to complete in the alloted time of the project, and i might continue work on it with some collaberaters. if we were to continue work i would increase the scope of the project as i did limit my creativity due to time limitations.
